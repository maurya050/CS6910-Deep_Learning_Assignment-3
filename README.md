         * This file contains the code for Question 1 to Question 3
        
         * In this .ipynb file , i have trained the vanilla model and then run sweeps.
        
         * To run the file on Google Collab at TA end, import the file and then,  change the wandb login key.
         
         * And also change the google drive dataset link.
                            
         * Now, just run the file from the start you will get all the results mentioned.

         * This file contains the code for Question 4
        
         * In this .ipynb file , i have trained the vanilla model on best parameter.
        
         * I found LSTM as my best model, where we got the Highest Validation Accuracy of 56.4%.
         
         * And also change the google drive dataset link.
                            
         * Now, just run the file from the start you will get all the results mentioned.
